      <span> Warranties </span>
    </div>
    <div class="details">
      <ul>
        <li>It is important to note that Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc, manufactures very little of what we sell. Warranties are between you the purchaser and the manufacture of the products you purchase. We will do everything we can to assist you in any and all warranty claims including repair/replacement. But the process by which any warranty situation is handled is determined by the manufacture and not Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc
        </li>
        <li>We <em><b>DO NOT</em></b> provide any assistance with warranty issues arising on merchandise which was sold and/or taken outside of the United States. In these situations, we will provide contact information for the manufacture and nothing more! In any case, all freight charges arising from returns, exchanges, service or anything else is the sole responsibility of the purchaser.

      <span> Cancellations/Returns
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="details">
      <ul>
        <li>Due to the nature of our products, changes or cancellations to an order can only be accepted the day the order is placed, and may require written notice of such action. However,<b><em> "rush" or same day shipping</b></em> of an item per the customers request, is an exception to this policy, and <b><em>NO changes or cancellations are accepted.</b></em>
</li>
        <li>Any "authorized" product return is subject to a restocking fee! </li>
        <ul>
          <li>This amount will range from <b></em>20% to as much as 50%</b></em>, depending on the manufactures policies. In addition, the customer is responsible for all freight charges in both directions.
          </li>
          <li> Returned products MUST be in new condition with all shipping cartons/manuals/packaging in place, and be accompanied by a "return authorization" number. If not, additional charges may be assessed, and/or the return may be rejected. In the event we are forced to reject your return, you will be responsible for the freight charges to return the product back to you once again.
          </li>
        </ul>
  <li>Many of the items we sell are special order or custom manufactured to your specifications.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples of this are the lead markers and lead aprons. All such products are NOT returnable! It is your responsibility to ask before ordering a product from us, if that particular item is a "special order" item, and therefore will not be returnable later on if you wish to do so</li>
    <li>No returns, which are "authorized", will be accepted after 30 days from the shipment date of your product.</li>
